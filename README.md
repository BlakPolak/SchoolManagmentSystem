# The story
Do you love geometry? Our young friend Zigy (Zygfryd) loves it too. Unfortunately it's one-sided love. He's studying hard for his high-school exam, but with minor success. You've got to help him!

But how?

You'll write a Object Oriented Python Application to teach him geometry. Don't worry! Our Finnish software architect Linus Coolvalds has already created a boilerplate for you.

# Requirements
In order to help Zigy you have to:
* Implement 6 classes in `geometry.py` module
* Implement `main.py` module.
* You are allowed to implement your own modules. Remember about clean code.
* Explain why Linus designed some methods to be class methods instead of instance methods.
* Remember about comments and docstrings.
* All tests must pass.
* Focus most on the OOP not the ui.

Hint: you can reuse code from the previous assignments.

# Specifications
Here you can find information what you have to implement.

## main.py
This is the main entrance of the program.   
The program allows user to create and add shapes to a list and do some things with it.

Running `python main.py` should show such menu:
~~~
Learn Geometry.
  What do you want to do?
  (1) Add new shape
  (2) Show all shapes
  (3) Show shape with the largest perimeter
  (4) Show shape with the largest area
  (5) Show formulas
  (0) Exit program
~~~


### Features
As you can see the program has 5 features.

#### 1. Add new shape
This feature allows user to add new shape to shapes list. User should be able to choose what kind of shapes he/she wants to add. Then he/she should specify attributes that a given shape requires.

#### 2. Show all shapes
This feature should print table containing all shapes added to the list. Take a look at `ShapeList.get_shapes_table()`

#### 3. Show shape with the largest perimeter
This feature prints shape with the largest perimeter from a list.  

#### 4. Show shape with the largest area
This feature prints shape with the largest area from a list.

#### 5. Show formulas
This feature should allow user to choose shape type and print it's formulas (perimeter, area).

## Classes
This is the most important part of this assignment. You've got to implement all of them in `geometry.py` module.

### Shape Class
This is a so called _abstract class_. It means that we don't create instances of it. We only use it as a parent class for other concrete classes. This parent is a boilerplate for it's children. It contains attributes and methods that should be implemented in child classes.

#### Instance methods
##### ```__init__(self)```
Constructs shape object. Should raise `ValueError` if any of the parameters is below 0 (e.g. circle with negative radius doesn't exist).
##### ```get_area(self)```
Returns the area of the shape.
##### ```get_perimeter(self)```
Returns the perimeter of the shape.
##### ```__str__(self)```
Returns information about given shape as string.

#### Class methods
##### ```get_area_formula(cls)```
Returns formula for the area of the shape as a string.
##### ```get_perimeter_formula(cls)```
Returns formula for the perimeter of the shape.

Why this methods should be class methods? Edit this readme and give answer below:  

They work on class objects instead of instances objects.

### Circle Class
This class represents circle shape.

Override (implement) other methods inherited from the parent class.  
Required formulas:
Perimeter = 2×π×r
Area = π×r<sup>2</sup>

Override (implement) methods inherited from the parent class.     
Required formulas:  
Perimeter = a + b + c  
Area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)),  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where s = (a+b+c)/2  
<sup>[Heron's Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron's_formula)</sup>

### Equilateral triangle Class
This is a triangle that has all sides equal.  
![alt](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/EquilateralTriangle_1000.gif "Equilateral triangle")
#### Parent class
Triangle
#### Attributes
Hint: check if you can reuse attributes from the parent class
* `a`
  * data: float
  * description: side's length of a triangle

#### Methods
`__init__(self, a)` - constructor of the Equilateral Triangle

Decide on your own if you have to override inherited methods.

### Rectangle Class
This class represents rectangle shape.  
![alt](http://www.numberempire.com/shapes/images/rectangle_main.png "Rectangle")
##### Parent class

  * data: float
  * description: second side length

Override (implement) other methods inherited from the parent class.      
Required formulas:  
Perimeter = 2a + 2b  
Area = a×b

###### Return value

###### Return value
`Shape` object

##### `get_largest_shape_by_area(self)`
Returns shape with largest area. Hint: have a look at [comparison methods]( https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__)

# Extra
If you've fulfilled all the basic requirements and you're ambitious enough to continue, here's idea what you can do.

Help Zigy even more and implement quiz feature. This feature should generate random shape. Tell the user the type of shape and it's attributes. The user should calculate the perimeter and area. The program should check users answer.

You can also add more shapes to the geometry class.
